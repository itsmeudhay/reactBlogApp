      "body": "Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist who is best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electrical supply system. He was born on July 10, 1856, in Smiljan, Croatia, which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n\nTesla’s work laid the foundation for the development of many modern technologies, including wireless power transmission, radio, and the modern electric grid. He held over 300 patents worldwide and made numerous groundbreaking discoveries in the field of electromagnetism.\n\nOne of Tesla’s most significant achievements was the development of the AC electrical system, which allows for the efficient transmission of electricity over long distances. This system is still used today to power homes, businesses, and industries around the world.\n\nTesla also conducted extensive research into wireless power transmission and wireless communication. He envisioned a world where electricity could be transmitted wirelessly, eliminating the need for power lines and allowing for the widespread distribution of electricity to even the most remote locations.\n\nIn addition to his work in electrical engineering, Tesla was also a pioneer in the field of robotics. He developed several prototypes of robotic devices and envisioned a future where machines would perform tasks that were too dangerous or difficult for humans.\n\nDespite his many achievements, Tesla’s later years were marked by financial difficulties and relative obscurity. He died on January 7, 1943, in New York City at the age of 86.\n\nTesla’s contributions to science and technology continue to be celebrated today. His work laid the foundation for many of the technologies that we rely on in the modern world, and his vision of a future powered by clean, renewable energy continues to inspire researchers and innovators around the world.",
